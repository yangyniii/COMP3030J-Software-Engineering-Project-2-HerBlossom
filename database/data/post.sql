However, I did not choose civil engineering out of my own will when I graduated from a local university. After graduation, I entered a state-owned construction company. Due to various factors, I chose to resign and go for postgraduate studies two years later. So far, I have been studying for one and a half years.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">However, in the first year after resignation and the second year, I chose civil engineering because I was unwilling to study it despite my reluctance. It was just to make it easier for me to pass the exam. However, during the preparation process, I was not so determined because I saw that most people graduating with a master\'s degree in civil engineering did not have a good career path. Even a master\'s degree from a top university might not guarantee a good job. They might still return to construction companies. So during the preparation period, I did not give it my all. I just hesitated and moved forward slowly.</span></div><div>I would like to ask everyone for their suggestions for this year. Many of my thoughts are in conflict in my mind. One is that if I take the exam again this year, I will be 30 years old when I graduate from the master\'s program. Although even if I don\'t take the exam, I will be 30 anyway, I still want to consider choosing this path based on my future life direction. Currently, I have roughly these few ideas:</div><div><ol><li>I can continue to study civil engineering and choose a slightly better school because this major is not particularly difficult now. However, considering the future graduation and employment issues, since civil engineering may not be so good in the future, and since women are not as capable as men, there are still concerns.</li><li>I can take the exam to switch to a new field. Anyway, I have never liked civil engineering. I have always studied engineering and I hope to go to some popular industries, such as electrical engineering or new energy. I hope to be able to deeply specialize in one industry for five to ten years and achieve the desired salary growth. However, when companies hire, they still prefer men. And this field is very competitive. If I want to switch to a new major, I need to make a choice at the school level. But at that time, I chose civil engineering because I thought that the title of a good university, whether it is for teaching or anything else, would be much smoother than the old school. However, the current information resources I have are all in the civil engineering direction. For other fields, I may have to look elsewhere.</li><li>I can return home to take the civil service exam. My age is here, and having a stable job is still possible. But I\'m afraid that the issue of my education will always be a thorn in my heart. If it\'s not covered, it might still be a heartache. Mainly because I\'m facing the situation of possibly having to find a partner, get married, or get married. At 30, it might be difficult to find a partner.</li></ol><u>These paths all have their advantages and disadvantages. To the friends at the end, I hope you can give me some help and suggestions. Thank you all.</u></div>', 'seeking suggestions', 'General', 0, '2025-05-12 17:16:49', '');
