I joined a construction company and worked there for two years. Then I resigned and found a job with less money but closer to home. I went back to school to pursue a postgraduate degree in full-time civil engineering. The first year, due to the English exam score being only 50 and not reaching the university\'s independent admission line for individual subjects, although the total score was sufficient, I still couldn\'t enter the re-examination. Disappointed, I didn\'t apply for a transfer. As a result, the second year\'s results were similar to the first year. I was tired of it. If I could have transferred, I would have done so. After the first round of exams, a classmate sent me a notification about the recruitment for military civilian positions. Relying on my decent performance in Math 1, I took the civil service exam directly and finally got a score of 75 for the general subjects and 83 for the professional subject (Math 1), ranking first or second. However, when the results were announced, the postgraduate transfer was already confirmed, so I went to Nanjing to experience the civil service interview. Only I was the only one who passed the 1:3 ratio. In the end, I gave up the admission. I have been studying for one and a half years. My ultimate goal is still to take the civil service exam, but I don\'t regret giving up the civil service position. I hope I can graduate on time and welcome the successful admission. Also, I wish you all the best.', '2025-05-12 17:26:14', 0);
